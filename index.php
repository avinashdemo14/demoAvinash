<h4 style="font-weight: bold;"> What is a portfolio ???</h4>
<p>
 
The portfolio can have the same purpose as a CV. Most CVs are written with text, while the portfolio is for showcasing, so it is visual with images and often more detailed than the CV.

It is a place where you can show your work experience and showcase the projects that you are most proud of.

Your online portfolio can be shared with its link to companies, hiring managers, and recruiters, so that they can notice you.

It is about showing and giving others an understanding of who you are as a professional.
